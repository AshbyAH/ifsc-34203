        <h2>My Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity
          is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the
          message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is
          about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a
          necessarily large amount of data.
        </p>
        <p class="alert">
          This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization
          and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized"
          chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a
          time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once.
          Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information
          rather than the illumination of it.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the
          information properly using HTML
        </p>
        <h4>
          Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title"
          attribute.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The "alt" attribute is used to display alternative text when an issue
          occurs that prevents an image from being loaded, or as an
          accessibility feature for users who use a screen reader. On the other
          hand, the "title" attribute is essentially a tooltip that is displayed
          next to the cursor when a user hovers over the element.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from
          the dictionary

        <dl>
